# CE221-Ass2
Second assignment in CE221 C++ module

Ex1 - To parse a text file containing students, modules taken, and their marks. This information is parsed and the results displayed to screen and offering the user to select between 2 functions: First show students attaining marks higher than user input mark, Second showing students attaining lower than user input mark.

Ex2 - To parse a text file containing any words and to offer the user 3 filters: First count words containing one lowercase and no uppercase letter, Second count all words containing two letters and one digit, Third count words containing one letter and one punctuation

Although the exercises seem simple, some parts were more complex than others; and it helped reinforce wording with pointers, references, common data structures from the STL. It gave a good foundation to build upon, although again it would have been awesome in hindsight to have known more about Unit testing and TDD in C++
