If there are many occurrences of one or more word, the chart will need scaling, using one asterisk for
every n occurrences. If you do this, your output must indicate the scaling and the actual numbers
should be shown alongside the bars, as seen above. To gain maximum marks the scaling factor should
be chosen so that 20 asterisks are used for the word with most occurrences (so for example if the most
frequent word occurs 98 times you would use 1 asterisk for 1 to 5 occurrences, 2 for 6 to 10
occurrences , and 20 asterisks for 96 to 100 occurrences). The word file will contain at least one word
that does not occur in the text; such words should be distinguishable from words that do occur, so a
word that appears in the text must have at least one asterisk in the chart, but words that do not occur
should have no asterisks. The leftmost column of asterisks should be aligned as shown above.
